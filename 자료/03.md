# Scheduling Basics
## Vocabulary
- Workload: set of job descriptions (arrival time, run_time)    
    - Job: View as current CPU burst of a process
    - Arrival time: When the jobs will arrive and begin
    - Run time: the time a job takes to process
    - Process alternates between CPU and I/O works
        - Process moves between ready and blocked queues
- Scheduler: logic that decides which ready job to run
- Metric: measurement of scheduling quality

## Scheduling: Introduction
- Workload assumptions
    1. Each job runs for the **same amount of time**
    2. All jobs **arrive** at the same time
    3. All jobs only use the **CPU** (i.e., they perform no I/O)
    4. The **run-time** of each job is known

## Scheduling Metrics
- Performance metric: ``Turnaround time``
    - The time at which **the job completes** minus the time at which **the job arrived** in the system

$$T_{turnaround} = T_{completion} - T_{arrival}$$

- Another metric is ``fairness``
    - Performance and fairness are often at odds in scheduling

## First In, First Out (FIFO)
- First Come, First Served (FCFS)
    - Very simple and easy to implement
- Example:
    - A arrived just before B which arrived just before C
    - Each job runs for 10 secs
- Gantt chart: Illustrates how jobs are scheduled over time on a CPU

$$Average turnaround time = \frac{10 + 20 + 30}{3} = 20 sec$$

### Cons: *Convoy effect*
- Let's relax assumption 1
    - Now each job **no longer** runs for the same amount of time
- Example:
    - A arrived just before B which arrived just before C
    - A runs for 100 seconds, B and C run for 10 each

$$Average turnaround time = \frac{100 + 110 + 120}{3} = 110 sec$$

## Passing the Tractor: Shortest Job First (SJF)
- Run the shortest job first, then the next shortest, and so on
    - Non-preemptive scheduling
- Example:
    - A arrived just before B which arrived just before C
    - A runs for 100 seconds, B and C run for 10 each.

$$Average turnaround time = \frac{10 + 20 + 120}{3} = 50 sec$$

### SJF with Late Arrivals from B and C
- Let's relax assumption 2: Jobs can arrive at any time
- Example
    - A arrives at t=0 and needs to run for 100secs
    - B and C arrive at t=10 and each need to run for 10 sec

$$Average turnaround time = \frac{100 + (110-10) + (120-10)}{3} = 103.33 sec
