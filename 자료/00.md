# Overview

## Difference of Hardware and Architecture
- Hardware
    - The physical design of a computer
- Architecture
    - The software programmer's idea / usage of hardware
    - These programmers do not consider the specifics of the hardware such as where in the disk, etc.
    - The functions of the architecture

## OS
- software that converts hardware into a useful form of applications

## Three Easy Pieces
1. Virtualization
    - Processes
    - CPU scheduling
    - Virtual memory
2. Concurrency
    - Threads
    - Synchronization
3. Persistence
    - Storage
    - File systems

## xv6 Project
- teaching OS developed by MIT

## Project Plan (1)
- Initially, the source tree of xv6 has skeleton codes
    - Do nothing but testing the functionality
- Fill in the empty code to provide the required features

## Project Plan (2)
- Lab sessions
    - A separate class with the TA
    - Once when each project term begins
    - Explanation of project assignment
    - Q&A
    - Hints & helps
    - Oral tests
    - COde review
    - ...

## Project Plan (3)
- Topics
    1. Booting (2nd Week, 1 week)
    2. System Call (3rd week, 2 weeks)
    3. CPU scheduling (5th week, 2 weeks)
    4. Virtual Memory (7th week, 2 weeks)
    5. Page Replacement (10th week, 3 weeks)
    6. File systems (13th week, 2 weeks)
